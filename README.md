# [lamemakes.com](https://lamemakes.com) Ghost Theme üëª

üèóÔ∏è **This theme is a WIP and will likely be ugly in both code & UI until finished** üèóÔ∏è

This theme is based off of the [Ghost Starter Theme](https://github.com/TryGhost/Starter), utilizing icons from [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com)

## TODO

## Routing

This theme uses a custom `routes.yaml` to accomodate the custom views of blog/pics, which is the following:

```yaml
  /pics/:
    controller: channel
    filter: tag:[pics,pic]
    template: pics
  /blog/:
    controller: channel
    filter: primary_tag:-pic
    template: blog


collections:
  /:
    permalink: /{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: primary_tag:-pic


taxonomies:
  tag: /tag/{slug}/
  author: /author/{slug}/

```

Here, only posts with tags of `pic` & `pics` will show under `/pics/` while everything that doesn't have a **primary** tag of `pic` will show under `/blog/`. I manually tag all photos that have a gallery with `pics`, and any random individual picture I want to upload are tagged with `pic`
